Create an encapsulated abstraction of the book preview by means of a single factory function.

Previously, I worked on adding abstraction around the book preview functionality of the project. You must turn the book preview abstraction into a fully-working web component. 

Highlight the following:

* What problems did you encounter converting the book preview to a component?
* What other elements make sense to convert into web components? Why?
* Why does it sometimes make sense to keep your HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a single file?
